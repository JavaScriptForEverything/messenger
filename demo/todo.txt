Bug fixed:
	. search-people reset input value on searchPeople blur, so that after blur new value for search works
	. show/hide friendList and FriendsNotfound container
	. change selected friendList user.id => user._id 	: else it shows undefined




. instead of re-send response request via seperate event, use 3rd callback function


problem:
	. friend list is empty whows even though friends available
		- instead of empty friend list, use class to toggle between 2 children: empty and friend-list-container


problem-2:
	- can't filter out callerUserId, and calleeUserId on disconnect

problem-3:
	- whose users exists in busyPeers in backend: to call them send busy, else CALL_AVAILABLE 


Problem:
	. When calling then every users not calling caller or callee can't call each other
			- Reason: send busy to every body else.
			- Solution: instead of send every body busy, send which users are busy by object, and filter those user when try to call
					const busyUsers = [
						{
							userId,
							socketId,
							callStatus: 'BUSY'
						}
					]

	. disable every button on click for api request and enable back of response: success or failed

	. on click user list, add ?userId=user.id, and then select that user on page refresh in UI
		instead of friends[0] 
	. handle text + image and File only via WebRTC
	

- Only return required fileds from database by .select({...})

We can add content in 2 ways:
	1. From Server-Side at first + Client-Side newly added (without page reload)
	2. Only From Client-Side

	- If SEO required then Method-1 is mandatory
	- But here our message and friend list no need any SEO related task so client-side is easier way
---

. add logout popup in top-left user's avatar icon click handler


. add audio duration and date dynamically
. add tick mark to your audio message
. add active indicator in left panel list item
. hide the scroll bar or style scroll bar too, but don't disable scrolling completely, mouse scroll must be available


Problem-1: Layout not 100% fit in small mobile
	- Reason: in left-panel position `absolute` applied and it also have padding p-1
						which add top and bottom too which is extra space cause the problem
						if we remove padding our layout need to adject so that always have 4px badding in all side
	
	- Target always keep 4px space in all side:
	- solution: 
			1. try add margin to parrent instead of padden self






- add documentation + routes
	/docs/
		. 

- handle image upload image type limit error
	. inside drag and drop
	. file browse
