Problems: Virtual Property not found
	. virtual property not get from 'pageRouter', but works on 'api: userRouter' 
			userSchema.virtual('fullName').get(...) 

Solution:
	- virtual property of `mongoose` created after parse to json. so
		we have to parse _doc to JSON string, but this way doc will be string, so we have to
		parse again back to object from json.
		
	change
				const user = await User.findOne({ _id: userId }) 					: => no virtual property in .pug file
	to
				let user = await User.findOne({ _id: userId })  					: => no virtual properties
				    user = JSON.stringify( user ) 												: => Shows virtual properties
				    user = JSON.parser( user ) 														: convert back to object


task:
	. on click user list, add ?userId=user.id, and then select that user on page refresh in UI
		instead of friends[0] 
	. handle text + image and File only via WebRTC
	

- Only return required fileds from database by .select({...})
- handle population failed senerio on messages


musicData = [
	{
		name: 'song-name',
		url: 'songurl.mp3',
		artist: 'artist name',
		cover: 'song cover photo: shows as rotating disk'
	}
]

We can add content in 2 ways:
	1. From Server-Side at first + Client-Side newly added (without page reload)
	2. Only From Client-Side

	- If SEO required then Method-1 is mandatory
	- But here our message and friend list no need any SEO related task so client-side is easier way

. add logout popup in top-left user's avatar icon click handler


. add audio duration and date dynamically
. add tick mark to your audio message
. add active indicator in left panel list item
. hide the scroll bar or style scroll bar too, but don't disable scrolling completely, mouse scroll must be available


Problem-1: Layout not 100% fit in small mobile
	- Reason: in left-panel position `absolute` applied and it also have padding p-1
						which add top and bottom too which is extra space cause the problem
						if we remove padding our layout need to adject so that always have 4px badding in all side
	
	- Target always keep 4px space in all side:
	- solution: 
			1. try add margin to parrent instead of padden self
