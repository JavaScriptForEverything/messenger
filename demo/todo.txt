WebRTC Call need time to open camera ready
	- how to wait for them

production: 
	. don't load images properly after logout.

. change webrtc-signal on server-side to multiple seperate listener  to reduce complexity
. use store like redux store


- File upload show progress bar
	. 

- on new message: update friendsList latest message, instanly, without page refresh


Probme:
	- webRTC screenShare got nested screens

Problem:
	. call recording stopped when switching webCam <==> screenShare
	Reason:
		. handling recording based on [ recorder.state === 'inactive' ] inside start call handler

	solution:
		. use onstop event instead of [ recorder.state === 'inactive' ]


		

- handle image optimization
	. multiple image 
	. set uploaded image size
	. show image size crose limit error in both frontend and backend side



Loading:
	. when fetch user on selected user (by click friend list)
			. add skeleton for middle-top as well as messaging body

Scripts:
	. create script to backup database and restore again: before creating production demo


task:
	. Try to apply apiFeatures on every route.
	. disable every button on click for api request and enable back of response: success or failed
	. File sharing only via WebRTC
	

- Only return required fileds from database by .select({...})
- handle population failed senerio on messages

. add logout popup in top-left user's avatar icon click handler


. add tick mark to your audio message
. add active indicator in left panel list item
. hide the scroll bar or style scroll bar too, but don't disable scrolling completely, mouse scroll must be available
