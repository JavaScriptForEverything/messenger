Problems:
	. virtual property not get from 'pageRouter', but works on 'api: userRouter' 
			userSchema.virtual('fullName').get(...) 



get current active users via socket.io and show those users in UI
	. fetch only filtered users
	. show in left panel in UI in client-side


---
We can add content in 2 ways:
	1. From Server-Side at first + Client-Side newly added (without page reload)
	2. Only From Client-Side

	- If SEO required then Method-1 is mandatory
	- But here our message and friend list no need any SEO related task so client-side is easier way
---

. add logout popup in top-left user's avatar icon click handler


. add audio duration and date dynamically
. add tick mark to your audio message
. add active indicator in left panel list item
. hide the scroll bar or style scroll bar too, but don't disable scrolling completely, mouse scroll must be available


Problem-1: Layout not 100 fit in small mobile
	- Reason: in left-panel position `absolute` applied and it also have padding p-1
						which add top and bottom too which is extra space cause the problem
						if we remove padding our layout need to adject so that always have 4px badding in all side
	
	- Target always keep 4px space in all side:
	- solution: 
			1. try add margin to parrent instead of padden self
